# API Table

The aim is to provide an API Table of three APIs in Geonames.

## UX

Each API has a name (e.g. Ocean) and description.  There is a Submit Button to submit user inputs.

The description includes user inputs.  For example, in the Ocean API there is latitude and longitude.

The APIs are Ocean, Hierarchy and Siblings.

**Getting Started**

In the Ocean APIs enter the latitude (between -90 and 90) or just accept the default value (40.78343) and longitude (between -180 and 180) or just accept the selected value (e.g. -43.96625).  Select the Submit Button.  You will see the distance, geoname ID and name of ocean or sea.  If the ocean or sea cannot be found for this latitude and longitude, a message will appear instead.

In the Hierarchy APIs select the placename or attraction (e.g. Cambridge) from the dropdown list or just accept the selected value (e.g. Bromley).  Select the Submit Button.  You will see the names and feature codes.  For example, Bromley has names of Earth, Europe, United Kingdom, England, Greater London, Bromley, Bromley.  Its feature codes are AREA, CONT, PCLI, ADM1, ADM2, ADM3, PPLA3.

In the Sibling APIs select the country name (e.g. France) from the dropdown list or just accept the selected value (e.g. United Kingdom).  Select the Submit Button.  You will see the names and toponym names.

Repeat if needed.
